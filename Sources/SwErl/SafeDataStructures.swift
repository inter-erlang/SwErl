/// Defines commands for interacting with a thread-safe dictionary.
///
/// The `SafeDictCommand` enum specifies the set of operations that can be performed on the safe dictionary,
/// allowing for addition, removal, retrieval, and access to keys or values in a thread-safe manner.
///
/// - Cases:
///   - add: Adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary. If the key already exists, the value is updated.
///   - remove: Removes the key-value pair associated with the specified key from the dictionary.
///   - get: Retrieves the value associated with the specified key from the dictionary or nil if none is found.
///   - getKeys: Retrieves all keys from the dictionary.
///   - getValues: Retrieves all values from the dictionary.
///   - getRaw: Retrieves an unsafe copy of the raw dictionary object, including all key-value pairs.
///
/// This enumeration is utilized within the `buildSafe` function to define the type of operation
/// to be executed on the safe dictionary in response to messages received by the SwErl process.
///
/// - Complexity: add - O(1), remove - O(1), get - O(1), getKeys - O(k) where `k` is the number of keys, getValues - O(v) where `v` is the number of values, getRaw - O(1). Swift's 'copy-on-write' behavior allows the return of the raw, underlying dictionary without duplication.

/// Constructs a thread-safe dictionary with specified initial state and processing logic.
/// The `buildSafe` function initializes a safe dictionary by creating a new SwErl process
/// with specific behaviors for adding, removing, and retrieving values based on commands received.
///
/// Example Safe Dictionary Use: "friends" ! (SafeDictCommand.add,"bob",3)
/// adds the key "bob" and matching value 3 to the 'friends' safe dictionary of type [String,Int].
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - dictionary: The initial state of the dictionary of type `[K: V]`, where `K` is the key type and `V` is the value type.
///   - named: The unique `String` identifier for the process associated with the safe dictionary.
/// - Throws: An error if the process creation encounters issues.
///
/// The safe dictionary supports various SafeDictCommands such as add, remove, get, getKeys, getValues, and getRaw,
/// allowing for dynamic interaction with the dictionary in a thread-safe manner.
