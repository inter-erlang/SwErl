/// This extension provides a convenient way to decode data that follows a specific format used in Erlang's external term format, particularly for atom cache references. Atom cache references are a part of Erlang's optimization for sending atoms across nodes.

/// The expected format is a single byte indicating the tag (82 for atom cache references) followed by the actual atom cache reference data. This property allows for easy extraction of both the tag and the subsequent data, facilitating interaction with Erlang systems or protocols that utilize atom cache references.
